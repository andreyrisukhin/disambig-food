# disambig-food
Disambiguate between types of foods, based on their starch content and that starch's placement


Inspired by https://cuberule.com/ and discussion with friends. The plan: 
1) Get improved logic (mashed potato -> nachos, toast and pie alignment)
2) Review improved logic with committee
3) Train CV model to identify the starch content in an image and output where it is located on the "cube model", a multiclass classifier
